Differences from Publication Stats
-----------------------------------
There are fewer tweets in here than we mentioned in the paper referenced above. That's because
we made another pass through it and found LOTS of duplicates. We reduced those wherever possible, 
though we know there are stil some close duplicates in here (say the same RT from different people). 
 
So it goes. Handle them as you wish
