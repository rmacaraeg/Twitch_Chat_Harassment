       "      <th>(0b4797b2dff0afaa, no seriousy the only thing i think actually did or said against your precious wikipedia policies was saying that if i really had my way half of you would be shot ignoring for a while the fact that i was obviously joking it happens to be my religious belief that the human race on a whole would be much much better off if  of the population died tomorrow that does not mean i go around killing people or making specific death threats against individuals and do not you actually have the sense to realize that if someone says oh my god you are such a fucking idiot just go die already that they probably do not want you to die or more accurately they do not care very few people actually have the emotion required to sit and pray for the death of another person or group of people and i am not one of those people if you really wanted to show off what a horrible and insensitive person i am edit which was on a wiki talk page is probably not the best granted nothing pisses me off more than people who see letters like  and  and automatically assume that whatever is written is russian the cyrillic alphabet is used in many slavic languages as well as central asian former soviet republics and even mongolia so i called someone an idiot boo fucking hoo maybe he could have said what language is that  instead of assuming that it was russian however insulted he was by me calling him an idiot i can guarantee you that i was at least times as insulted by him calling that russian i am a proud native russian and will not have my culture besmirched with these allegations your other example how i am a bad contributor is what a spelling correction  or was it the fact that my edit summary was how i felt about the sad fact that niggers cannot spell  do not even think about raising issue of my use of the word i live in harlem around here that word is used like a comma and before you try to tell me the difference between nigga and nigger there is none it called a dialect while for some purposes it makes sense to write things phonetically as they are pronounced by the person saying them i find it is usually clearer to spell properly also a nigger to me at least is not a black person i am not a racist i do not even draw distinctions between people in my holy opinion there is a nigger inside of all of us people like you for instance who take offense for no reason i mean was saying black people are stupid and i think they should be marginalized in society tarred and feathered strung up on trees dragged through town by their enormous wangs etc  no and if that is what you heard i would like to know why are you black   of the black people i know personally use the word nigger more than i do  are why we as a society still cannot get over the silly idea that words are harmful words are not harmful ideas are harmful one particularly harmful idea is that certain words are so unspeakably horrible that nobody can be allowed to say them for any reason at all you want to end racism forever  stop freaking the fuck out every time you see the word nigger seriously i happen to be a priest and a docktor and saving humanity is just one of my many responsibilities fucks like you make me hate it but i still do it that what a good person i am i forgot what else i was going to complain about i mean i could complain about everything on wikipedia not because i am uncivil but because there are enough wikipedos to make this community unbearable for normal well  adjusted individuals such as myself if you look at all my page edits they were all good for the encyclopedia ok there was one tiny exception  a long time ago i saw someone changed a caption on scottish fold to winston churchill someone else reverted it and i reverted it back i felt it was an appropriate caption to that particular image but everything else was beneficial to improving the quality of the content i may be a little hard on people who are hung up on things that are wrong but i only do what is right that is why i put it on my user page i do not do wrong things if you try to argue with me you will be in for a world of hurt butthurt to be exact but you have nobody to blame but yourself unlike you i actually warn people first but no you fags have to be humorless oversensitive fascist wikipedos with your unwarranted self  importance and your administrative powers well you can go fuck yourselves if you ever succeed in getting all sand out of your vaginas i joined wikipedia because i wanted to make it better and that was all i did but i guess you cunts actually enjoy bathing aro, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)</th>\n",

       "3   more i cannot make any real suggestions on improvement - i wondered if the section statistics should be later on or a subsection of types of accidents - i think the references may need tidying so that they are all in the exact same format ie date format etc i can do that later on if no - one else does first - if you have any preferences for formatting style on references or want to do it yourself please let me know there appears to be a backlog on articles for review so i guess there may be a delay until a reviewer turns up it listed in the relevant form eg wikipedia : good_article_nominations#transport                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "3   more i cannot make any real suggestions on improvement - i wondered if the section statistics should be later on or a subsection of types of accidents - i think the references may need tidying so that they are all in the exact same format ie date format etc i can do that later on if no - one else does first - if you have any preferences for formatting style on references or want to do it yourself please let me know there appears to be a backlog on articles for review so i guess there may be a delay until a reviewer turns up it listed in the relevant form eg wikipedia : good_article_nominations#transport                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "10  fair use rationale for thanks for uploading i notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in wikipedia articles constitutes fair use in addition to the boilerplate fair use template you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale if you have uploaded other fair use media consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too you can find a list of image pages you have edited by clicking on the my contributions link (it is located at the very top of any wikipedia page when you are logged in) and then selecting image from the dropdown box note that any fair use images uploaded after may and lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded as described on criteria for speedy deletion if you have any questions please ask them at the media copyright questions page thank you (talk  contribs  ) unspecified source for thanks for uploading i noticed that the file description page currently does not specify who created the content so the copyright status is unclear if you did not create this file yourself then you will need to specify the owner of the copyright if you obtained it from a website then a link to the website from which it was taken together with a restatement of that website terms of use of its content is usually sufficient information however if the copyright holder is different from the website publisher then their copyright should also be acknowledged as well as adding the source please add a proper copyright licensing tag if the file does not have one already if you created took the picture audio or video then the tag can be used to release it under the gfdl if you believe the media meets the criteria at wikipedia : fair use use a tag such as or one of the other tags listed at wikipedia : image copyright tags#fair use see wikipedia : image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use if you have uploaded other files consider checking that you have specified their source and tagged them too you can find a list of files you have uploaded by following [ this link] unsourced and untagged images may be deleted one week after they have been tagged as described on criteria for speedy deletion if the image is copyrighted under a non - free license (per wikipedia : fair use) then the image will be deleted hours after if you have any questions please ask them at the media copyright questions page thank you (talk  contribs  )   \n",
